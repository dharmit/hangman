hangman
=======

A simple hangman game using Python

Just run this game on the command line as 

$ python hangman.py

and get going. There's no rocket science here.

There are a few assumptions made here:

1) You are using a Linux box.
2) I created this game on Fedora and words package was pre-installed.
 
  yum install words

should install the package on RHEL/Fedora your system.
